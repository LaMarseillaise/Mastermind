# Mastermind

[Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) is a two-player board game created in 1970 by [Mordecai Meirowitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordecai_Meirowitz). In the game, one player is assigned as the "Code Maker" and the other the "Code Breaker".
The Code Maker creates a secret code sequence, which is represented by four pegs, each of one of six colors. The Code Breaker then has 12 attempts to determine what the secret code sequence is by being told, by the Code Maker after each attempt, which pegs they matched exactly, or otherwise were matched with the right color in the wrong position.
